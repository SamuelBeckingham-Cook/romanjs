# roman.js
A Javascript library for converting numbers to-and-from symbolic representations.

By default, this will convert any number to it's Roman numeral equivalent (and vice-versa!) with the widely accepted subtractive notation system.
However, it will - Eventually - provide a means to define your own numerals and even subtractive notation system.

Really awesome for passing around secret messages that are composed entirely of numbers...  Or something.
